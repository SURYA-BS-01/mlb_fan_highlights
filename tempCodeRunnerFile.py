      "content": "The scoring kicked off in the top of the 2nd when Nathaniel Lowe blasted a solo home run to right-center field, putting the Rangers ahead early.  However, the Angels responded immediately in the bottom half of the inning.  Logan O'Hoppe started things off with a single, and Niko Kavadas followed with another single, putting runners on first and second. Michael Stefanic then ripped a line drive that bounced into the stands for a ground-rule double, scoring O'Hoppe and advancing Kavadas to third.  Taylor Ward then grounded out to shortstop, but it was enough to bring Kavadas home, tying the game.  Jack López capped off the inning with a ground ball single to third, scoring Stefanic and giving the Angels a 3-1 lead.  But the see-saw battle continued!  In the bottom of the 3rd, after Brandon Drury singled and O'Hoppe singled again, Gustavo Campero launched a three-run homer to left field, reclaiming the lead for the Angels and making it 6-1 after Kavadas followed up with a solo shot to center field.  The Rangers chipped away in the top of the 4th. Adolis García singled and advanced to second on a fielding error.  Nathaniel Lowe singled, moving García to third, and Leody Taveras walked to load the bases.  Carson Kelly then grounded into a double play, but García scored on the play, narrowing the Angels' lead.  Wyatt Langford then stepped up in the top of the 6th and hammered a solo homer to left-center, bringing the Rangers within one run.  The Angels extended their lead again in the bottom of the 6th in a messy play.  Niko Kavadas and Michael Stefanic walked, and Taylor Ward singled to load the bases.  Eric Wagaman then hit a fielder's choice to shortstop, where a fielding error by Josh Smith allowed Kavadas to score, pushing the Angels' lead to two.  The Rangers mounted a late-game rally in the 8th. Matt Duffy singled, and Nathaniel Lowe doubled sharply to center, scoring Duffy and cutting the deficit to one.  Jonah Heim then followed with a triple to right field, scoring Lowe and tying the game!  The drama peaked in the top of the 9th.  Marcus Semien walked, Wyatt Langford walked, and Matt Duffy was hit by a pitch to load the bases.  Nathaniel Lowe then walked, forcing in Semien and giving the Rangers the lead.  Jonathan Ornelas then delivered a bases-clearing single to right field, scoring Langford, Duffy, and Lowe, and reaching second himself on a throwing error.  This explosive play extended the Rangers' lead to four runs, effectively sealing the game despite a scoreless bottom of the 9th for the Angels.  What a rollercoaster of a game!"
